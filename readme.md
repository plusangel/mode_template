# The mode template

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/plusangel/mode_template.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/plusangel/mode_template)

This is a template function that calculates the mode of a series of values.
This value is the one that appears most commonly in the array.
If we encounter an error condition, such as input having multiple modes and no values, we return zero.

We only accept an **Integer** concept.
